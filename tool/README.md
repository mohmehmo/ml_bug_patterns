# LOG6306 Group Project
Group project of LOG6306 course

We use Python3.8 for our executions

We extract all repositories using Python programming languages and one of the three most popular ML frameworks including Keras, Tensorflow, and PyTorch. 

Criteria for filtering out repos
1. should not be a forked repository.
2. at least 10 forks.
3. at least 10 stars.
4. at least one activity (commit, ...) during last year.
5. at least 100 commits.
6. at least 2 contributors.

We achieved 191 refactoring commits from all (300) ML-based repositories.
